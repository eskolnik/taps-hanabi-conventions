# Pink and Brown
### Known Pink Tempo Play Clue
If a Tempo Clue reveals one or more of the retouched cards to be Pink, the clue giver must have had a Free Choice when deciding between a number- or color-clue to give. This is because it’s no longer possible to have any additional Pink cards. One of two plays are indicated:
If ‘pink’ was given, the focused card (left-most) is immediately playable (nothing more else is promised about any remaining pink cards).
If a number clue was given instead, this indicates a Positional Play Clue on the corresponding slot in the player’s hand.
    
*Example:*
From previous hints, Bob’s slot 3 has been touched with 2, and slot 5 with 5. Pink 3 has already been played.
Alice clues ‘4’ to Bob, which only retouches slots 3 and 5. 
Bob now sees his slot 3 must be his only Pink card, and notes that this is a Tempo Play Clue. Bob realizes Alice could have clued Pink, but chose to clue 4 instead.
Bob blind plays his slot 4 card as a Positional Play Clue.


### Brown Tempo Play Clue
If a Tempo Clue retouches one or more cards marked as Brown, the player should play their rightmost card touched and only their rightmost card touched. This acts as a Focus Inversion for two reasons: 
There is never a direct way to further distinguish brown cards once hinted
It is least likely for the oldest brown card to have been able to get a chance to get Finessed, 5-Pulled, Pushed, Ejected, etc.
Because of the above mentioned points, a tempo clue with brown does not indicate all of the touched cards are playable since out-of-order brown cards are so difficult to play.


### Duplicate Playable Card Actions
If a player has two known duplicated, playable cards, several extra messages can be sent based on the action they decide to take. All are listed below:

* Playing Leftmost: Players are expected to play and discard known playables of equivalent priority and known trash from left to right. That said, the player can now mark whatever card would have been prompted/finessed as known not playable at the moment due to this choice.
* Playing Rightmost: This technically violates Priority, and therefore should trigger a Priority Prompt/Finesse/Bluff (it could still be interpreted as a Layered Priority Finesse, but only in multiplayer games when directed at someone off bluffseat.)
* Discarding Leftmost: This action triggers a Scream Discard Chop Move. Unlike a basic Chop Move, this has two special properties, to be noted:
  * The chop-moved card must be critical or immediately playable.
  * Also, the player being screamed at is not allowed to discard this turn.
* Discarding Rightmost: This technically violates Priority, and therefore should trigger a Trash Order Chop Move (since the duplicated card is soon-to-be known Trash). That said, the player should now be able to mark their chop-moved card as NOT “critical or directly playable” (meaning very likely to be exactly 1-away-from-playable)

# 2P Hard Variant 
### 4 Bluffs
Often in harder variants (either high efficiency or difficult mixes) it is more either:
a) A card can’t be touched due to complexity of cards
b) Required efficiency leans away from touching single cards as play clues
Because of the difficulty of getting cards played, it can be even more valuable to get cards blind played from finesse position. Therefore, we agree that in a 2P hard variant a 4 play clue that does not ‘get’ a matching card should be considered a bluff and play should end after a single card.
